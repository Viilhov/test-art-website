                <p>
                    As a child growing up in London, I loved my holidays with my cousins in Sussex, constantly drawn to
                    the openness of the countryside and the vast expanses of the sea. Journeys to the Scily Isles and
                    Cornwall, with its
                    pagan landscape, brought more magic to my life and more light. <br><br>
                    I was brought up in an environment of artists and it seemed natural to become a student ni Florence,
                    Italy, studying at the School of Fine Arts. I am, however, mostly self-taught and was only able to
                    take up painting
                    seriously in my forties.<br><br>
                    I am excited by the elements, in particular fire, sky and the way light reflects on water.
                    The restless surface of the sea holds a fascination for me as do the wonderful skies that are
                    ever-changing here in
                    Cumbria, where I came to live 25 years ago. <br><br>
                    Living here in a natural environment is, for me, the best milieu for living and
                    working.

                    Travel is essential to my life and I am greatly influenced by the Mediterranean culture and climate.
                    On recent holidays in Crete and Provence, I have found the same brooding skies, shimmering seas and
                    forest fires that I
                    have found at home. <br><br>
                    I use a mixture of techniques in my work, sometimes laying a foundation in acrylic or watercolour
                    and then working in pastels over the top. I like to work on rough hand-made paper or canvas using
                    techniques such as
                    frottage and grattage.<br><br>
                    I work both in plein air and from photographs back at my studio at Green Door Studios.<br><br>
                    In 2001 I became a studio member of the Green Door Studios in Kendal which has enabled me to work
                    virtually full-time on my painting and my jewellery making. I have spent the last three years
                    working in silver and selling
                    my jewellery through the Wave Gallery in Kendal and Best Cellars ni Dent, Cumbria. <br><br>
                    My paintings are exhibited at Tinners' Rabbit,
                    Ulverston and the Sedbergh Art Gallery, Cumbria. <br><br>
                    Living and working in Cumbria with its landscape of grim and wonderful contrasts is endlessly
                    inspiring to me. It's a
                    place I will always want to come back to.
